<h1 align="center">Hello, Iâ€™m Nolan</h1>
<h4 align="center">A hobbyist who loves creating things using programming, 3D printing, and paint!</h4>

When I'm programming, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm wanting to start learning React, so I can step up my skills and just learn how everything works. I also have my hand in Python but haven't found many opportunities to use it to it's full extent. 

My other hobbies are watercoloring and 3D printing. At the end of 2024 I bought [Bambu Lab's A1](https://bambulab.com/a1) and have been learning Fusion 360, which is used for modeling prints. Check out my [Maker World profile](). I also love hanging out with others and playing Pickle Ball
